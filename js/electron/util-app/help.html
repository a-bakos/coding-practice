			Used sounds:
			All the sounds come from freesound.org, see the sources and the licences linked below. Also, all of the sounds have been slightly edited by me, e.g. they have been cut, made loopable, compressed and re-titled for the extension.

			As for the quality, I find the following compression just enough for the purpose: 44.1kHz 24bit STEREO VBR OGG.

			The following sounds are the amazing field recordings of Tim Kahn aka Corsica_S:

			(License: CC-BY)

			Botanical garden, Fire, Cityscape, Dawn, Wind, Snow, River, Frog pond

			Summer night (this sound is a mix I made of two recordings):

			[1] CC-BY by Corsica_S
			[2] CC0 by johnaudiotech
			Cafe CC0 by FlorenceArt

			Icons:
			The used and modified icons originally come from Flaticons.net.
